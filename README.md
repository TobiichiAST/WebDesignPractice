# web_design_practice
This repository is used to practice. Website and Github.
Don't view it. Most of the stuff are crappy cause it is used for practice only.

Bacially I can do all thing locally on my computer, but I want to practice how to use github at the same time. Github also provides easier support for me to view it on my phone. So, Yea!

Really, practice only.
